All html files for the San Bruno 4-H Club website.
Hello 4-H Webmasters!
This is the GitHub Repository where the 4-H Website will forever live in glory! GitHub is a very powerful tool that allows us to make changes to the same document online, very much like a Google Doc. This program will allow us to directly contribute to the website, as well as see what changes are made, when, and by whom they are made!

All around great work so far! I hope this makes it simpler for everyone (just don't forget to upload the html page via FileZilla to the server when you are done playing with it... GitHub does not update the server with the newer file!)

Thanks for the hard work,
Alexander
